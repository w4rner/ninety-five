        It's the 'original template' for the web, before the dawn of CSS & JS. 
        It's accessible & mobile-responsive by default, so you can't go too wrong (or too right, some would say).

        <h2>Bio Blurb</h2>
        <p>If you wanted to be part of the invention of a lifetime, Silicon Valley in 1991 was the right place and right time. 
            Given the gender skew in Stanford University's CompSci dept, Tamara Munzner might have been one of the first females to publish a personal website, 
            but to this unassuming data visualiser who'd go on to a successful academic career in Silicon Valley and beyond, it was no big deal and "we just called them home pages", last modified in 1995 - 
            when I was born, but CSS & JS weren't. 
            So she told me during my Master's when she gave me her blessing to publish a homage under Creative Commons.  This licenses other young people to build on this template and get started exploring - without the complexity and ethical muddle of vibe-coding in modern frameworks - 
            the possibilities of creating on the web by simply modifying code. </p>
